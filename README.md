# Welcome to the DataJam!

## Getting set-up
If you want to code your solution with the available data you have a few options:
  1. Clone this repository to your computer and get started with your own set-up for Datascience/ML/AI/cognitive modelling.
  
  2. If you *do not* have a set-up, and would like to get started quickly:
     - Go to https://jupyterhub.app.rug.nl/hub/ and log in with your RUG credentials. This is an experimental set-up for a Jupyter Lab server, it might have some bugs, but it works well.
     - Request a ** Datascience Environment ** from the available server options. This will take about 2 minutes to set-up.
     - Once you see the Jupyter Lab environment, open a Terminal and clone this repository. 
     - I have provided initialized Jupyter notebooks - one with a python kernel and the other with an R kernel, choose whichever you would like and get-started!
  
  3. If you *do not* have a set-up, and would like to get started *slowly*:
     I will be on hand to help you get-set up : D 

## Data description
The dataset we will be working with contains student fact learning data
