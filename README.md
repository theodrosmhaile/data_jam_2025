# Welcome to the DataJam!

## Getting set-up
If you want to code your solution with the available data you have a few options:
  1. Clone this repository to your computer and get started with your own set-up for Datascience/ML/AI/cognitive modelling.
  
  2. If you *do not* have a set-up, and would like to get started quickly:
     - Go to https://jupyterhub.app.rug.nl/hub/ and log in with your RUG credentials. This is an experimental set-up for a Jupyter Lab server, it might have some bugs, but it works well.
     - Request a ** Datascience Environment ** from the available server options. This will take about 2 minutes to set-up.
     - Once you see the Jupyter Lab environment, open a terminal and clone this repository.
